# DrugtargetMR-workflows

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex human traits, necessitating post-GWAS analyses to improve statistical efficiency and predict candidate genes. By leveraging large-scale genotype and multi-omics data across tissues, researchers can pinpoint tissue-specific quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with methylation, mRNA expression, splicing, protein abundance and so on. Integration of QTLs with GWAS data through advanced bioinformatics methods enables systematic exploration of susceptibility loci underlying complex diseases. However, bioinformatics research requires substantial programming expertise, making it difficult for scientists focused on research questions to effectively use most post-GWAS analyses. Similarly, implementing MR involves multiple complex steps, particularly when analyzing downstream effectors, creating barriers for many researchers. To address these challenges, we developed DrugtargetMR upon the existing tools (such as FUSION TWAS and UTMOST), a comprehensive R package that streamlines the investigation of GWAS summary statistics. In addition, we provide four commonly used workflows to help users effectively conduct analyses for exploring susceptibility loci and genes associated with diseases.
